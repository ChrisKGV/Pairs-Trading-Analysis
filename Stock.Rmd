###Topic :			  Exploring the Pairs Trade Stock Trading Strategy

For the longest period of time, people used hunches and educated guesses on deciding when to buy and sell stock. However, as we enter the digital age, people rely more on data, statistics, algorithms and computers to create a more concrete plan. Throughout the years, there have been many different strategies and one such strategy is Pairs Trade. Also call Position trading, this particular trading strategy typically involves trading two highly correlated assets. 

For example, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 indexes typically move together, therefore they have a high correlation. Traders that employ Pairs Trade look for deviations in this type of relationship and then attempt to exploit them. If the Dow moves higher while the S&P 500 drops, the trader takes a short position in the Dow and a long position in the S&P 500. Historically, the two ETF indexes have shared similar dips and highs, depending on the market. If the price of Dow were to go up a significant amount while S&P 500 stayed the same, a pairs trader would buy S&P 500 stock and sell Dow stock, assuming that the two indexes would later return to their historical balance point. If the price of Dow rose to close that gap in price, the trader would make money on the Dow stock, while if the price of S&P 500 fell, he would make money on having shorted the S&P 500 stock. In other words, sell high price stock of the overperformer and buy low price stock of the underperformer. The strategyâ€™s profit is derived from the difference in price change between the two, rather than from the direction each moves. Therefore, ratios are used instead of continuous stock values.
Pairs Trade relies on the notion that deviated stock will come back to its original value. However, that in itself is an assumption. It is assumed that the pair will have similar business conduct as in the past and will continue to do so in the future. Unfortunately, that is not always the case. For example, Pepsi and Coca Cola used to be the subject of Pairs Trading. But, in late 2014, both companies diverged to the point of non-correlation and, as a result, the strategy is rendered useless. Pairs Traders need to keep in mind of this probable future as the strategy only works when met with certain criterias. 
 
In exploration of this topic, the project at hand will fulfill two things :

1) A demonstration on how Pairs Trading work and how it is programmed in R.

  i) A detailed walkthrough on its multiple functions and algorithms

  ii) A visualization of the ratios used in actual trading

  iii) Examples with real companies and scenarios

2) Answer 3 questions regarding this particular trade strategy
	i) The Limits and Capabilities
		a) When can you use it/not use it
b) What criteria are needed to met first	
	i) Debunking myths on which companies are compatible/correlated

**** Why Would You Buy Shares of Stock? ****

Investors buy stocks primarily to make a profit. But that said, it's not the only reason to buy stocks. Let's look at the most common reasons people buy stocks in the stock market:

1) To make money. When stocks appreciate in value and are worth more than the investor paid to buy the stock, that's a positive outcome for investors.
To earn dividend payments. When a publicly-traded company pays out dividends to shareholders, that adds value (and income) for the shareholder.
To gain influence at a company. Stock market shareholders have the ability to vote on company matters and key issues.

2) To outflank inflation. Inflation eats into income. Thus, making money on stocks helps investors stay ahead of inflation.

3) To save for retirement and other long-term financial objectives. Since stocks appreciate over time, much more so than bonds or bank deposits, they are a great tool for investors looking to save for the long-haul -- especially for retirement.

  **** Why Would You Sell Shares of Stock? ****
  
Once you buy a stock, you have the ability to sell it whenever you like. Under what conditions would you normally sell a stock? These factors come into consideration:

1) To make a profit. You buy a stock for 10 dollars per share and six months later, it's worth 20 dollars per share. That's a good reason to sell stocks -- to make a profit.
The stock represents too much risk. Often, people sell stocks to reduce risk. For example, if  shares have grown so much that the stock represents a major portion of an investor's portfolio, an investor may sell some or all of those shares to reduce that risk and create a more-balanced, or diversified, portfolio. 

2) You are worried about the company. Sometimes, company fundamentals change and you don't have the same positive outlook you had on the stock when you bought it. It could be a scandal at the company, a new CEO, or bad news on the financial front. Each could be enough for someone to sell their stock.
You need the money. If you have short-term cash needs -- paying for a child's college tuition, buying a home, or starting a business, for example -- selling a stock can give you an immediate cash infusion.

You like another stock better. Often, investors sell shares of stock so they have the cash to buy another stock that they believe offers better value.

    ENTRY POINTS
When Z-score crosses upper threshold, go SHORT - Selling Over Performer:
      #Sell stock A
      #Buy stock B

When z-score crosses lower threshold, go LONG - Selling the Under-Performer :
      #Buy stock A
      #Sell stock B

    EXIT POINTS
TAKE PROFIT is defined as scenarios where you take profit before the prices move in other direction. For instance, say you are LONG on the spread, that is, you have brought stock A and sold stock B as per the definition of the spread/z-score. The expectation is that spread will revert back to mean or 0. In a profitable situation, the mean would be approaching to zero or very close to it. You can keep Take Profit scenario as when the mean crosses zero for the first time after reverting from threshold levels.

  Train, Validate and Optimize

Now, ready to use the functions manufactured to find the best K value from "training" historical data and then apply the optimal K to test the data sets. 

Finding the optimal K or K-Ratio is absolutely important. It dictates and indicates where the upper and lower bound are placed as well as the optimal or "correct" positions.

train = overlap[i, ]
test = overlap[ - i, ]
